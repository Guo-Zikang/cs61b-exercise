1. ListOfSets List<Set<Integer>>
2. Array
The indices of the array represent the elements of our set.
The value at an index is the set number it belongs to.
3. We assign each item the index of its parent. 
If an item has no parent, then it is a 'root' and we assign it a negative value.
4. Whenever we call connect, we always link the root of the smaller tree to the larger tree.
5. We can connect all the items we visit to their root.
总结：
The naive implementation was maintaining a record of every single connection. Improvements
made were:
- Keeping track of sets rather than connections (QuickFind)
- Tracking set membership by recording parent not set # (QuickUnion)
- Union by Size (WeightedQuickUnion)
- Path Compression (WeightedQuickUnionWithPathCompression)
